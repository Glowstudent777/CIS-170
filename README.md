# CIS-170

This is a repository for my CIS-170 class. It will contain all of the projects and assignments that I complete for this class.

### Running the code

#### Python

To run the Python code, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run the code by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the Python file you want to run.

#### Java

To run the Java code, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the JDK from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

Once you have the JDK installed, you can compile and run the code by executing the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac <filename>.java
java <filename>
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the Java file you want to run.

#### C++

To run the C++ code, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can use a compiler like g++ to compile the code.

Once you have a C++ compiler installed, you can compile and run the code by executing the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <filename>
./<filename>
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the C++ file you want to run.
